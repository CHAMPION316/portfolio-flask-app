                <p class="fs-5 center-me">
                    Born and raised in New Jersey for the first 26 years of my life, 
                    I embarked on an extraordinary journey when I got married at the 
                    age of 26 and moved to Sweden. Surprisingly enough, I became an 
                    acrobat on roller skates and had the incredible opportunity to 
                    work for Cirque Du Soleil. Yes, you read that correctlyâ€”I am an 
                    acrobat on roller skates! Now, you might be wondering, how did 
                    I transition from being an acrobat to pursuing programming? 
                    Well, as fate would have it, the pandemic dealt a severe blow to 
                    the entertainment industry, leaving me with the realization that 
                    I needed a backup plan. Throughout my life, I've always been 
                    fascinated by computers and had a lingering interest in 
                    programming since my days on Myspace. I dabbled in HTML back then, 
                    which kept my passion for programming simmering in the back of my mind.
                    That's when I began researching various courses, and YouTube's 
                    algorithm led me to CodeInstitute. Their online program resonated 
                    with me the most, as it offered a comprehensive curriculum 
                    tailored to my needs.

                <p class="fs-5 center-me">
                    Fast forward to today, I have successfully graduated and acquired 
                    a broad range of skills that you'll find detailed on my skills 
                    page and resume. Although I haven't had the opportunity to work 
                    professionally as a programmer due to my commitments as a busy acrobat, 
                    I have dedicated myself to honing my skills and staying engaged by 
                    working on challenging projects. By doing so, I aim to demonstrate 
                    to potential employers that I possess the necessary knowledge and 
                    expertise. I made a promise to myself that a year after completing 
                    this certification, I would begin applying for programming jobs. 
                    And now, I'm ready to embark on this exciting new chapter in my life. 
                    I am fully prepared to bring my passion, determination, and acquired 
                    skills to contribute to a dynamic team."
